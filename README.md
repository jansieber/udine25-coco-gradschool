* Complicated motivating example: Rate-induced tipping (folder [r_tipping](r_tipping) for code).
* Using `coco` for bifurcation analysis in ordinary differential equations.

## Tuesday
* Bare-metal `coco`: the low-level user interface on which the toolboxes (e.g. for bifurcation analysis) are built (folder [bare-metal](bare-metal) for code).
